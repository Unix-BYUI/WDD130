          <p>From the image below create a webpage to look just like it. Try using grid for the layout.
             The grid doesn't necessarily need to be the whole card but at least the bottom portion of the card. 
             The card below has a small width so it should look good on any screen. 
             The image below is how it would look on a medium size screen.
             You are welcome to work in groups. The image is provided below.</p>
